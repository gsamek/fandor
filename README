Coding test for Fandor.com

  
 Please write Ruby code -- a class or so -- that models an elevator in a tall building.
 It should have a button for each floor, and there should be up and/or down buttons as appropriate on each floor.
 Calling code -- you might want to think of the calling code as messages to and from the real-world elevator, buttons, etc.
 -- should be able to call the elevator and choose a floor, and the elevator should eventually visit that floor.
 Don't worry about door buttons or other complications for now. Definitely don't worry about anything except moving the
 elevator around in memory; this is a Ruby exercise, not a Rails exercise.
 
 Write the code test-driven with rspec. (Test::Unit or MiniTest would be fine too. Don't use Cucumber; we love it, but
 it's too bulky for this exercise.) Refactor it until it's clean enough to eat on. Put the results on github and send me
 the URL. If you have any questions please ask. Those instructions are ideal, so do whatever you think is appropriate and
 have time for. The point is for us to see how you test and code and refactor, not to test your knowledge of specific
 technologies.
 
 The exercise should take no more than an hour. If you think it will take much longer (aside from time taken to learn new
 tools), you might think I'm asking for something that I'm not, so check with me to make sure you've understood the scope.
 Also, it should be fun; if it isn't you should feel free to adjust the requirements until it is. Keep it simple, though,
 since if it gets complicated it will be hard to work on when you visit.
